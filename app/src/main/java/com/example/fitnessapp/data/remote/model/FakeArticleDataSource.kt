            "Things You Need to Know About Exercising on the Keto Diet",
            "If you’ve decided to try out the ketogenic (“keto” for short) diet, you probably hope to reap some of the myriad health benefits it claims to bring. The keto diet is designed to put the body in a state of ketosis. When your body is in ketosis, it is burning fat as a fuel source, as opposed to running on carbohydrates. The touted advantages of keto include weight loss, boosted energy, and fewer blood sugar swings.\n" +

                    "One question mark around the diet, however, is whether or not it does your exercise any favors.\n" +

                    "“We have very little evidence that says the ketogenic diet is better for anything exercise-wise,” says Andy Galpin, PhD, a professor of kinesiology at California State University in Fullerton. Though for some types of exercise, it might affect performance more than others."

                    "Although it’s common to hear the recommendation to get 10,000 steps per day at a minimum, that number isn’t actually based on any research, says Bruce Bailey, PhD, professor of exercise sciences at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. According to Harvard Medical School, the number actually originates from a Japanese pedometer manufacturer, which created the promotion in 1965 as a way to tout its product.\n" +

            "What Is Running?\n" +
                    "Let’s start at the beginning. Running is the action or movement of propelling yourself forward rapidly on foot, according to Amy Morris, a certified running coach and head of personal training at CrossTown Fitness, a Chicago-based gym.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "It’s different from walking because when you walk, one foot is always on the ground. But with running, there’s a moment when both feet are off the ground. That’s what makes running a high-impact activity.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Depending on the type of running you’re doing, it can be aerobic exercise, anaerobic exercise, or a combination of both. Aerobic and anaerobic exercise are the two subtypes of cardiovascular exercise. During aerobic exercise, oxygen intake and heart rate stay consistent over a period of time, whereas anaerobic exercise involves quick bursts of energy performed at your highest level of effort for a short time.right up arrow\n" +
                    "Running is aerobic if you’re keeping your pace and energy expenditure fairly consistent. Think distance running and endurance training. The body uses oxygen to create the energy needed to keep you going, Morris explains. These workouts are traditionally long runs, easy pace runs, and recovery runs, and they should make up the majority of a runner’s weekly mileage.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Think of anaerobic running as sprints and other types of speed work. “With anaerobic running, your body is able to perform at high intensity using the stored energy in your muscles without oxygen, and this usually lasts anywhere from less than six seconds to up to two minutes,” Morris says. \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Morris suggests that the average adult spends a minimum of 16 to 24 weeks to build a proper base for efficient aerobic running. After that, anaerobic running can help improve performance, she says, especially in terms of speed."

And the opposing stretch is just as important as the contraction."

He recommends doing intense walking workouts no more than five days per week, to reduce the risk of injury. However, rest days don’t mean being entirely sedentary. It\'s okay to do light- or moderate-intensity walking every day, since getting steps in on a daily basis is beneficial to your health. (More on that below.)"

These folks are more susceptible to cardiac events when their heart rate goes up, and they should keep a close eye on exercise intensity. Fasting is a behavior that can make physical activity feel more strenuous, and therefore put people with these types of conditions at higher risk of running into complications than if they weren’t fasting."

Your arms also play a key role in moving you through the water.\n" +
